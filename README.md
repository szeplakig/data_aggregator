Problem Description
    You will get URLs from 2 different public APIs which will deliver some public hourly and daily data in JSON formats of their own, where we are interested only in a few of parameters
    You will create an API of your own, which would provide this data to clients, who can chose the source and returns a few parameters our clients are interested in
    you will display them in one local page, without any special design requirement
    you might want to provide clients with some aggregates of data, since some of the parameters are numbers
    Details about APIs will be provided
